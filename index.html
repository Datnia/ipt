          <h4>Founder / Executive Director</h4>
          <p>
            From an early age, while attending Springbrook High School and
            Montgomery College, Timothy Stewart discovered his passion for
            helping others through service projects with special needs students
            and at risk young adults. His driving force for his chosen
            profession is the desire to reduce the amount of deaths that are
            related to the lack of education about unhealthy habits that lead to
            diabetes and cardio vascular disease. He focuses on preventative
            treatment plans that are created to involve both exercise and
            healthy lifestyle changes. Since early 2015, he has impacted the
            lives of over 500 people with changing their unhealthy habits into
            obtainable health oriented goals. He has also mentored young adults
            through inspirational seminars with career building focus.
            <br />
            <br />
            He became a licensed trainer in 2008 and in his spare time managed
            to train almost 100 people while working full time and running
            summer camps for disadvantage youth. Mr. Stewart has participated in
            several charitable activities, which led to greater outreach
            opportunities. These opportunities have allowed him to reach out to
            more clients and educate more people about the risks of unhealthy
            life choices.
