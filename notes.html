    <h3>
      -I am open to any changes/edits you may have. This is just a soft launch.
      Sonia is also giving me small design feedback.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      -The video is there as a placeholder. I think if you compile short
      clip(s), it would work really well with the layout.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      -I am still working on the form processing and wanted to give you the
      client side of that section.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>-I still need some content from you (images and bio text / address)</h3>
    <br />
    <h3>-I am planning on doing a separate page for your events/charities</h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      -I know the map address is not correct. I just used that as a placeholder
      for now
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      -The website is not yet mobile friendly. I will do this once all of the
      designs have been finalized
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      -For the nav bar, I plan on having that stick at the top as you scroll.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Let me know your thoughts so far, Tim</h3>
