              From an early age, while attending Springbrook High School and
              Montgomery College, Timothy Stewart discovered his passion for
              helping others through service projects with special needs
              students and at risk young adults. His driving force for his
              chosen profession is the desire to reduce the amount of deaths
              that are related to the lack of education about unhealthy habits
              that lead to diabetes and cardio vascular disease. He focuses on
              preventative treatment plans that are created to involve both
              exercise and healthy lifestyle changes. Since early 2015, he has
              impacted the lives of over 500 people with changing their
              unhealthy habits into obtainable health oriented goals. He has
              also mentored young adults through inspirational seminars with
              career building focus.
              <br />
              <br />
              He became a licensed trainer in 2008 and in his spare time managed
              to train almost 100 people while working full time and running
              summer camps for disadvantage youth. Mr. Stewart has participated
              in several charitable activities, which led to greater outreach
              opportunities. These opportunities have allowed him to reach out
              to more clients and educate more people about the risks of
              unhealthy life choices.
