    <h3>
      -I am open to any changes/edits you may have. This is just a soft launch.
      Sonia is also giving me small design feedback.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      -The video is there as a placeholder. I think if you compile short
      clip(s), it would work really well with the layout.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      -I am still working on the form processing and wanted to give you the
      client side of that section.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>-I still need some content from you (images and bio text / address)</h3>
    <br />
    <h3>-I am planning on doing a separate page for your events/charities</h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      -I know the map address is not correct. I just used that as a placeholder
      for now
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      -The website is not yet mobile friendly. I will do this once all of the
      designs have been finalized
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      <strike
        >-For the nav bar, I plan on having that stick at the top as you
        scroll.</strike
      ><br />
      I decided to keep the nav bar at the top location; The logo is too big to
      work with.

    <h1>Revision #1</h1>

    <h3>
      -I have made some minor updates to the site. Let me know if you have any
      other suggestions.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      -For the video, I was thinking something more fitness related; Most web
      browsers don't allow autoplay with audio. <br />
      How about a quick clip of y'all sprinting forward and back?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Do you happen to have any pics of your other teammates? There are three of
      you guys, right? Also bio too.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Sonia created your favicon for you. Let me know if this is okay.
