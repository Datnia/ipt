            <p>
              Type 2 diabetes is when your body doesn’t use insulin properly. In
              type 2 diabetes, some people are insulin resistant, meaning that
              their body produces a lot of insulin but can’t use it effectively.
              Some people with type 2 diabetes don’t produce enough insulin.
              Type 2 is different from type 1 diabetes because in type 1, your
              body doesn’t produce any insulin at all. <br />
              <br />
              Whether you’re insulin resistant or have too little insulin, the
              end result is the same in type 2 diabetes: your blood glucose
              level is too high.

            <p>
              The symptoms of type 2 diabetes (also called type 2 diabetes
              mellitus) develop gradually—so gradually, in fact, that it’s
              possible to miss them or to not connect them as related symptoms.
              Some of the common symptoms of type 2 diabetes: <br />
              <br />
              &nbsp - Fatigue <br />
              &nbsp - Extreme thirst <br />
              &nbsp - Frequent urination <br />
              &nbsp - Extreme hunger <br />
              &nbsp - Weight loss <br />
              &nbsp - Frequent infections <br />
              &nbsp - Slow wound healing <br />
              &nbsp - Blurry vision <br />
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <h5>What causes type 2 diabetes?<i class="fas fa-plus"></i></h5>
            <p>
              Type 2 diabetes has several causes: genetics and lifestyle are the
              most important ones. A combination of these factors can cause
              insulin resistance, when your body doesn’t use insulin as well as
              it should. Insulin resistance is the most common cause of type 2
              diabetes.<br />
              <br />
              Type 2 diabetes is treated with a combination of healthy meal
              planning, physical activity, medications, and perhaps insulin.
              <br /><br />
              Healthy meal planning changes and exercise are the cornerstones of
              type 2 diabetes treatment. They often help people lose weight,
              which in turn can help their bodies use insulin better. Many
              people, when they’re first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, are
              overweight (BMI >25), so making healthy lifestyle choices—such as
              reducing calories and portion sizes and being more active—can help
              them get to a healthier weight.

              Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease
              in the US. Coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscle and
              coronary artery disease occurs when there is a buildup of
              cholesterol plaque inside the artery walls.

            <p>
              It's always best to check with your doctor, but most research

              a regular basis is best.

            <h5>Why is exercise important?<i class="fas fa-plus"></i></h5>
            <p>
              The heart needs exercise just like any other muscle. Muscles that
              are utilized regularly become stronger and healthier, whereas
              muscles that aren't used weaken and atrophy. When it's exercised,
              the heart can pump more blood through the body and continue
              working at optimal efficiency with little strain. This will likely
              help it to stay healthy longer. Regular exercise also helps to
              keep arteries and other blood vessels flexible, ensuring good
              blood flow and normal blood pressure.
              <br />
              <br />
              While a lack of physical activity raises the risk for heart
              disease, engaging in regular exercise lowers it. Consider the
              following: <br /><br />
              &nbsp - According to Elijah Saunders, M.D., head of the
              hypertension section of the University of Maryland School
              Medicine's Division of Cardiology, exercise helps control blood
              pressure because it stimulates "nitric oxide," which keeps blood
              vessels open. <br />
              <br />
              &nbsp - A study published in the British Medical Journal found
              that women who committed to regular brisk walks raised their
              levels of HDL ("good") cholesterol. This regular exercise
              correlated to an over 50 percent reduction in coronary events.<br />
              <br />
              &nbsp - Researchers found that heart attack patients who
              participated in a formal exercise program experienced a reduced
              death rate of 20 to 25 percent. Some studies showed an even higher
              rate of reduction. Several large reviews of past research also
              conclude that those patients who engage in exercise-based
              rehabilitation after a heart attack are more likely to live
              longer.<br />
              <br />
              &nbsp - A review of studies over the last half-century show that
              physical activity reduces the risk of coronary artery disease. The
              most physically active subjects generally had disease rates 50
              percent lower than those who are sedentary.<br />

              Born and raised in Laurel, MD, at the age of 23, Xavier has had a
              life, not like many that are in his age group. As a recent
              graduate of Salisbury University in Salisbury, MD (Class of 2017),
              Xavier graduated with a Bachelors of Science with his focus being
              Exercise Science. In the summer after his freshman year of college
              that is when he had his first major experience with
              entrepreneurialism by running his own financial services business
              for about two years. It was through this opportunity he was
              introduced to books such as "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki
              and "Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill that changed the
              trajectory of his life. It was through reading books of influence
              like the ones mentioned above that caused Xavier to become a
              bibliophile and average anywhere from 50-60 books in a year (with
              a goal to eventually reach 100). <br />
              <br />
              Topics such as personal development, athletic development (both
              mentally and physically), health and wellness are all topics that
              Xavier is a staunch advocate of, and it will be topics such as
              these that you will see him touch on throughout the various files
              of The Archives. Xavier has already taken it upon himself to speak
              publicly on these topics and now he has decided to expand his
              market and increase his content by providing written material to
              the public. If you would like to know more about any of the
              services he offers, such as speaking events and training sessions,

            <p>
              From an early age, while attending Springbrook High School and
              Montgomery College, Timothy Stewart discovered his passion for
              helping others through service projects with special needs
              students and at risk young adults. His driving force for his
              chosen profession is the desire to reduce the amount of deaths
              that are related to the lack of education about unhealthy habits
              that lead to diabetes and cardio vascular disease. He focuses on
              preventative treatment plans that are created to involve both
              exercise and healthy lifestyle changes. Since early 2015, he has
              impacted the lives of over 500 people with changing their
              unhealthy habits into obtainable health oriented goals. He has
              also mentored young adults through inspirational seminars with
              career building focus.
              <br />
              <br />
              He became a licensed trainer in 2008 and in his spare time managed
              to train almost 100 people while working full time and running
              summer camps for disadvantage youth. Mr. Stewart has participated
              in several charitable activities, which led to greater outreach
              opportunities. These opportunities have allowed him to reach out
              to more clients and educate more people about the risks of
              unhealthy life choices.
