            <p>
              Born and raised in Laurel, MD, at the age of 23, Xavier has had a
              life, not like many that are in his age group. As a recent
              graduate of Salisbury University in Salisbury, MD (Class of 2017),
              Xavier graduated with a Bachelors of Science with his focus being
              Exercise Science. In the summer after his freshman year of college
              that is when he had his first major experience with
              entrepreneurialism by running his own financial services business
              for about two years. It was through this opportunity he was
              introduced to books such as "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki
              and "Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill that changed the
              trajectory of his life. It was through reading books of influence
              like the ones mentioned above that caused Xavier to become a
              bibliophile and average anywhere from 50-60 books in a year (with
              a goal to eventually reach 100). <br />
              <br />
              Topics such as personal development, athletic development (both
              mentally and physically), health and wellness are all topics that
              Xavier is a staunch advocate of, and it will be topics such as
              these that you will see him touch on throughout the various files
              of The Archives. Xavier has already taken it upon himself to speak
              publicly on these topics and now he has decided to expand his
              market and increase his content by providing written material to
              the public. If you would like to know more about any of the
              services he offers, such as speaking events and training sessions,

            <p>
              From an early age, while attending Springbrook High School and
              Montgomery College, Timothy Stewart discovered his passion for
              helping others through service projects with special needs
              students and at risk young adults. His driving force for his
              chosen profession is the desire to reduce the amount of deaths
              that are related to the lack of education about unhealthy habits
              that lead to diabetes and cardio vascular disease. He focuses on
              preventative treatment plans that are created to involve both
              exercise and healthy lifestyle changes. Since early 2015, he has
              impacted the lives of over 500 people with changing their
              unhealthy habits into obtainable health oriented goals. He has
              also mentored young adults through inspirational seminars with
              career building focus.
              <br />
              <br />
              He became a licensed trainer in 2008 and in his spare time managed
              to train almost 100 people while working full time and running
              summer camps for disadvantage youth. Mr. Stewart has participated
              in several charitable activities, which led to greater outreach
              opportunities. These opportunities have allowed him to reach out
              to more clients and educate more people about the risks of
              unhealthy life choices.
